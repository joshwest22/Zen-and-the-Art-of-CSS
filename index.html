  <h2>Discuss what makes Zen Garden interesting.</h2>
<p>Zen Garden is not just your average website. 
  It is special because it allows you to change stylesheets for the whole site. It is meant to encourage people to try their hand at CSS by
  developing a stylesheet for the site. 
  They go as far as providing the html and stylesheet of their site for developers to base their designs on. </p>
  <br />
  <h2>Pick your favorite css design off of the site and describe
    at least one aspect of the layout given the reading that you completed for today. </h2>
<p>My favorite design I found on Zen Garden was <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/102/">"Revolution!"</a> by David Hellsing. </p>
