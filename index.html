  <h2>Discuss what makes Zen Garden interesting.</h2>
<div class="textbox">
    <p>Zen Garden is not just your average website. 
      It is special because it allows you to change stylesheets for the whole site. It is meant to encourage people to try their hand at CSS by
      developing a stylesheet for the site. 
      They go as far as providing the html and stylesheet of their site for developers to base their designs on.

  <h2>Pick your favorite css design off of the site and describe
    at least one aspect of the layout given the reading that you completed for today. </h2>
<div class="textbox">
<p>My favorite design I found on Zen Garden was <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/102/">"Revolution!"</a> by David Hellsing. I like this design because they have a cool faded amd aged theme with good color contrast. Additionally, I like the layout of the sidebar on the left that contains other designs. It seems that the sidebar on the left is either a &lt;sidebar&gt; element or a complicated box (&lt;div&gt;) element.

  <h2>Discuss an effect that was done with CSS that was not in your book.</h2>
<div class="textbox">
    <p>While I assume this was a box or sidecar element as amentioned above, I do not whether this is the case and it did not appear in the book otherwise. I am also curiouis about how they created a custom font that was textured and shadowed like the <q>Zen Garden</q> title of <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/102/">"Revolution!"</a> is. I am also curious about how they were able to get a pattern in the margins.
